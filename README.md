# INFSCI-0201-Final-Project

We have created an event management system called Event Garden. Event Garden is a booking website using Python and Flask where users can sign up for events, and managers can create events. Event Garden was designed to provide those in the field of business in the Pittsburgh area with an environment in which they can reliably plan team meetings and events located at various venues throughout the city. The Event Garden website aims to provide users with a simple-to-use scheduling software in which it is easy to view past, current, and upcoming events. Those viewing the website can create a user account where they can view and sign up for events, while those looking to manage events can create an event manager account where they will be able to create, edit, and delete events, and post their events for users to register for.

Please check requirements.txt to see what programs need pip installed in order to use our system.
